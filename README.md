# SpotifyDataCleaning

This repository contains code to clean and format two datasets:
- Spotify Most Streamed Songs dataset
- Billboard Hot 100 Songs from 2023

## Structure
- `data_cleaning.R`: R script to clean and format both datasets.
- `DataCleanAndFormatted/`: Folder containing the cleaned and formatted versions of the Spotify and Hot 100 datasets.

## How to Use
1. Run the `data_cleaning.R` script to clean the data and generate the output files.
2. The cleaned data will be saved as:
   - `Spotify_Cleaned.csv` and `Spotify_Cleaned.RDS` for the Spotify dataset.
   - `Hot100_2023_Cleaned.csv` and `Hot100_2023_Cleaned.RDS` for the Hot 100 dataset.
